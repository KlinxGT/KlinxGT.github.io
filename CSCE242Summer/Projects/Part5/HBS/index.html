                        <p>Just read 1984 by George Orwell. God what a read; it quite literally blew my mind. Just the
                            sheer depth of the story and the message behind it. I'm sure most people wouldn't understanding
                            the subtleties to it but it really struck me to the core. Blah blah blah I'm so smart, look at me yall
                            I read a book that's deep, I'm deep and wise and better than everyone. Please please please give me the 
                            validation and approval I never got from the friends I never had.

                        <p>Cute cafe I went to that I'll deliberately not say the name of and when 
                            asked, will gatekeep and reply: "Honestly it's a really low key place and a sanctuary to me". 
                            Also the coffee in question is 16 dollar plus the 40% tip that was somehow the lowest option
                            on the ipad they spun around for you to choose your tip.
