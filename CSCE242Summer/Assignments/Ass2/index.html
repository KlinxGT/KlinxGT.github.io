                <p>Ham is pork from a leg cut that has been preserved by wet or dry curing, with or without smoking. As a processed meat, the term ham includes both whole cuts of meat and ones that have been mechanically formed.
                    Ham is made around the world, including a number of regional specialties. In addition, numerous ham products have specific geographical naming protection. 
                    The preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with traces of production of cured ham among the Etruscan civilization known in the 6th and 5th century BC.

                <p>Traditional dry cure hams may use only salt as the curative agent, although this is comparatively rare. This process involves cleaning the raw meat, covering it in salt while it is gradually pressed to squeeze out fluid. 
                    Specific herbs and spices may be used to add flavour during this step. The hams are then washed and hung in a dark, temperature-regulated place until dry. It is then hung to air for another period of time.
                    The duration of the curing process varies by the type of ham. For example, Jinhua ham takes approximately 8 to 10 months to complete,
                     jamón serrano cures in 9–12 months, prosciutto di Parma takes more than 12 months, and Iberian ham can take up to 2 years to reach the desired flavor characteristics.
                       Many dry-cured hams, such as prosciutto, are eaten without being cooked. </p>
