                                Just read 1984 by George Orwell. God what a read; it quite literally blew my mind. Just the
                                sheer depth of the story and the message behind it. I'm sure most people wouldn't understanding
                                the subtleties to it but it really struck me to the core. Blah blah blah I'm so smart, look at me yall
                                I read a book that's deep, I'm deep and wise and better than everyone. Please please please give me the 
                                validation and approval I never got from the friends I never had.</p>
