    <h1>Eurydice and Orpheus</h1>
    <p>This is a ancient Greek Legend about Orpheus of Thrace
        and his wife Eurydice. The version I will be referring to is Ovid's version
        of the myth in <i>Metamorphoses</i>. This version employs a lot 
        of poetic emphasis. 
    </p>
    <p>In the story Orpheus is the son of Apollo, and a talented singer. He fell 
        in love with the beautiful Eurydice and they married happily. Eurydice
        is bitten by a snake and dies; to see his lover Orpheus descends into 
        the underworld and convinces Hades to let his wife come back to life with a 
        sorrowful melody. Hades told him if he can lead his wife back to the surface without 
        looking at her she will live again. 
    </p>
