                    <p>Faculty and students in the Department of Computer Science
                        and Engineering are advancing the theories, principles 
                        and applications of computing to design computers, software,
                        networks and processes. Our academic programs provide a foundation
                        in one of the fastest growing fields in the world, and the faculty
                            members engaged in research at USC ensure that we remain at the forefront
                            of computing.</p>
