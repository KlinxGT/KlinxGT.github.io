            My team collaborated and came up with some of the 
            issues that we might run into as well as some other factors
            to consider in regards to making tech parts eco-friendly.

            Tom has a broken laptop and after various failed attempts at 
            finding repairmen for it he was advised by his friend to use 
            our app. Doing so, he was able to use the web to search for 
            all the stores and find one he likes from the palm of his hands.

          <p>
            The paper prototype includes the three functions of the app: diagnostics, finding parts, finding repair shop.
            The Diagnostics screen asks the user some questions about the issue, the order parts
            is similar to amazon where you can search up any parts and track the shipping, and the 
            repair shop works like google and gives you location, ratings, prices, etc.
